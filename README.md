Mercury
=======

An internal [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web site
to provide services to PHS students and staff.

Polls and Elections
-------------------

In addition to LDAP authentication, the only service written so far is IRV elections. The code for that package can be found in the `voting` directory.


Django Settings
---------------

For security reasons, the actual settings.py file cannot be
included in the repository. Instead, a sample file (that I
may have trouble keeping up to date) is provided, with the
relevant information removed. The setting names should
hopefully be self-explanatory enough for now.
